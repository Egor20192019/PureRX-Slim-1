        <p>When you're crunched for time (which is like, always, I get it), it's pretty easy to throw in the towel on squeezing in a workout—whether because you're not sure what to do or because you think a 15-minute workout can't possibly be all that effective.</p>
		<p>Well, I'm a firm believer that even just 10 or 15 minutes of movement is *ALWAYS* better than none. No, you may not be able to train for a marathon or burn a full spin-class-worth of calories, but you can put a dent in your fitness goals—and drastically improve your mood—with super-quick workouts.</p>
		<p>After all, if you want to be fit for life, you've got to be flexible and willing to adapt to whatever schedule and lifestyle changes come your way. And, heck, sometimes ya just don't have the motivation to spend an hour sweating. I get it.</p>
		<p>If you've got time for just a 15-minute workout and want to get the most out of it, you must, must, must limit your rest as much as possible in order to cram as many reps as possible. Which specific moves you do, though, depends on your goals.</p>
		<p>To overload your muscles as much as possible to build strength and tone up, you might focus on one specific part of your body, whether it's your upper body, abs, or legs. This way, you can devote every minute to overloading them.</p>
		<p>However, if you want to sweat and burn whatever calories you can, full-body HIIT with plenty of compound movements is the way to go. This lightning-fast high-intensity workout hits all of your muscles hard—and, best of all, requires zero equipment.</p>

		<p><strong>Time</strong>: 15 minutes</p>
		<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: none</p>
		<p><strong>Good for</strong>: total body</p>
		<p><strong>Instructions</strong>: Perform each move below for the indicated amount of time, then continue immediately on to the next as quickly as possible. Once you've completed all seven exercises, repeat twice more for a total of three rounds.</p>
		<p><strong>Plank Toe Touch</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Start in plank position. Engage lower abs and lift hips to pull body into an upside-down “V” shape while reaching right hand back to touch left ankle. (Heels stay high the whole time.) Slowly return to start. Repeat on the opposite side. That’s one rep. Repeat for 45 seconds.</p>
        <p><strong>Lateral Lunge with Reach</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Start standing with feet wider than shoulder-width apart, hands at sides. Bend left knee to 90 degrees and push hips back and down, while simultaneously reaching right hand down toward left foot. Press through left heel to return to starting position and immediately repeat on the other side. That's one rep. Repeat for 45 seconds.</p>

        </figure>
		<p><strong>Lateral Hop</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Start standing with both feet flat on the floor. Take a big jump to the left side landing softly on left foot with right knee raised. From here, push off through left leg to leap to the right, landing one right leg with left knee raised. That's one rep. Repeat for 45 seconds.</p>
		<p><strong>Single Leg Deadlift</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Start standing on right leg with left leg slightly back behind body, toe pointed and resting on the floor, and arms by sides. Engage abs and slowly lean forward, lifting left leg straight back behind body, lowering torso toward floor, and extending left arm forward bringing bicep by ear until body forms a "T" shape. Drive into right heel to return to start position. That’s one rep. Repeat for 45 seconds.</p>
		<p><strong>Jump Squat</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Start in a squat (feet under shoulders, toes facing forward, thighs parallel to floor) with torso upright and hands clasped in front of chest. Press through feet to straighten legs and jump up off the floor while swinging straight arms behind body. Land back in a squat position. That's one rep. Repeat for 45 seconds.</p>

        </figure>
		<p><strong>Forearm Press Up</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Begin in a high plank position, then walk hands a couple of inches forward. From here, keeping gaze between hands, bend elbows, and lower down until forearms touch the ground. Pause, then press back up to start. That’s one rep. Repeat for 45 seconds.</p>
		<p><strong>Hollow Hold</strong></p>
		<p>How to: Start lying on back with arms and legs extended and on the floor. Raise arms and legs leaving just bra line and lower back on mat so body looks like a banana. Hold for 30 seconds.</p>
